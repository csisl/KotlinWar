# War

The classic card game: War, but written in Kotlin.  

Without placing the cards back into the players hand
at a random location the game runs for a crazy amount
of time (upwards of over 100K iterations). When the
cards are placed back into a players hand at random
it takes less than 400 turns for to get a winner.
